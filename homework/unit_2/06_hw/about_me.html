  <p>Hi, you may not know whose name that is that you might be currently reading on top of this website page, but the owner of that name you are currently or not currently looking at is my name, Zidanni Clerigo. <br><br>Zidanni Clerigo is an 
    amazing guy who loves eating food that is not green. I hate green food so much to the point that if I ever ate a green food I would never be able to enjoy my favorite hobbies again which include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class = "game"><a href = "https://www.psal.org/profiles/player-profile.aspx#1210803/054/2024" target="_blank">fencing</a></li>
      <li class = "game"> <a href = "https://www.wikihow.com/Hike">day dreaming about hiking</a></li>
      <li class = "game">Scrolling through tik tok until I become paralyzed</li>
    </ul>
  <p>As you can see, I am a very fragile person and I value my own personal health. I jog every 8th day of the week and only eat brown food like my own feces.<br><br> Below is an amazing picture of me when I was 3 years old.</p>
